_Last updated: 2026-07-23_

## Current status

Project is in active development.

Infrastructure and project architecture are considered stable.

Current version:

v0.1.0

Current development phase:

Phase 2 — Search Providers.

---

# Completed

## Infrastructure

- Python project initialized
- FastAPI running
- pytest configured
- development scripts
- Docker-ready architecture
- GitHub repository
- HomeLab mirror
- SSH authentication to GitHub
- single `git push` pushes to GitHub and HomeLab

## Documentation

Completed:

- ADR documents
- logging standard
- testing standard
- data model draft
- JSON schema
- project architecture

## Refactoring

Completed migration:

app/

    domain/
    providers/
    services/
    storage/
    config/

Old architecture removed.

## Phase 1 — Domain Model

Completed:

- Publication
- Author
- Affiliation
- Venue
- Identifier
- SearchRun
- SearchQuery
- Provenance
- ScreeningDecision
- screening decision enum
- decision rationale
- reviewer or supporting agent attribution
- audit trail
- backward compatibility contract tests

Phase 1 is considered complete.

## Phase 2 — Search Providers

OpenAlex completed increments:

- 2.1 client
- 2.2 cursor pagination
- 2.3 retries implemented with Tenacity
- 2.4 configurable asynchronous rate limiting

The rate limiter applies before every physical HTTP attempt, including retries and cursor-pagination requests. It is instance-local, concurrency-safe, configurable through `requests_per_second`, and can be disabled with `None`.

Retry continues to cover transient connection failures and retryable HTTP statuses, including rate-limit and server errors.

Quality status for OpenAlex 2.4:

- 73 tests passing
- Ruff checks passing
- mypy checks passing
- `git diff --check` passing

# Development principles

The project follows:

- Clean Architecture
- Domain Driven Design (lightweight)
- provenance-first
- reproducible science
- plugin providers
- YAML configuration
- OpenAlex first

Every feature must:

- have tests
- be documented
- preserve provenance
- avoid hidden AI decisions

---

# Next milestone

Implement OpenAlex provenance.

Next roadmap increment:

- 2.5 provenance

After that:

- completion of OpenAlex provider tests
- next search providers according to the roadmap

---

# Important notes

Infrastructure is considered finished.

Future work focuses on scientific functionality, not framework development.

Every larger change should be implemented as a reviewable PR-sized increment.

The roadmap is the authoritative sequence of work. Additional engineering tasks should be included within existing roadmap items unless a deliberate roadmap change is approved.

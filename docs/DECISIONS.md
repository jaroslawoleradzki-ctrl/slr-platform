# Architectural Decisions

This document records important project decisions that do not require a full ADR.

## 2026-07-21

### Infrastructure completed

The project infrastructure is considered stable.

Completed:

- GitHub repository
- HomeLab mirror
- SSH authentication
- FastAPI
- pytest
- development environment
- Docker-ready architecture

Future work should focus on scientific functionality rather than infrastructure.

---

### Architecture

The project adopts a lightweight Domain Driven Design.

Main layers:

- Domain
- Services
- Providers
- Workflow
- Storage

FastAPI acts only as the API layer.

---

### Scientific principles

The platform follows:

- provenance-first
- reproducibility
- deterministic processing
- human-in-the-loop

LLMs may assist the reviewer but must never make autonomous scientific decisions.

---

### Search strategy

The first implemented provider will be OpenAlex.

Additional providers will be added incrementally.

---

### Development strategy

Development proceeds in small reviewable increments.

Each increment should:

- pass tests
- include documentation
- preserve backward compatibility whenever practical
- be committed as an independent logical change

---

### Long-term vision

The SLR Platform is intended to become a reusable research tool rather than software dedicated only to the current PhD project.
